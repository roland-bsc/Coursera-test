What is HTML?
- annotates content
- defines document structure
- There is a right and a wrong way to write HTML

The web page has 3 web tech working together
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript


HTML 4.0 - 1997 - Standardized by W3C

XHMTL 1.0 - 2000 - based on XML - standardized by W3C
- problem is the browser vendors decided that W3C is too slow

WHATWG HTML - 2004
- Web Hypertext Application technology Group
- a LOT less democratic than W3C

WHATWG & W3C start to work together - 2007
- W3C decided to work together with the vendors

HTML5 - 2011

W3C in charge of HTML5

WHATWG - HTML evolving - they kinda do what they want coz they make the browsers, right?

Browser silently update themselve nowadays

www.w3c.org - standard and useful but somewhat academic

caniuse.com - a useful website for keeping tracks of the changes in the browsers
- you can test your code in this site and see what browser supports your code or not

validator.w3c.org - Another validator providad by W3C
